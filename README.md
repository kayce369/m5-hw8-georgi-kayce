## Issues

The lecture from the week helped with wrapping my brain around what was going on with the DOM. I don't feel like loops have been heavily covered in previous courses, so I need to learn more about what exacly is going on in those - but it helped to walk through it during the lecture.

I didn't run into as many issues as I thought I would with this project. I generally knew what I was supposed to do with some help from Google.

I actually was surprised how much I had to re-remember with CSS since we've been out of practice the past few weeks! (Though, I'm glad this wasn't a CSS-heavy project.)
